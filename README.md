# The Social Space - ~~Deconstructing the algorithm~~, to socially construct it  

## Project Description

In a world dominated by social media algorithms, "Social Space" emerges to bring transparency to the forefront of technology. Social media algorithms, often hidden in the shadows, dictate the content we encounter daily. The lack of understanding regarding these algorithms has led to concerns related to privacy, mental health, and the shaping of individual perspectives.

## Problem Statement

The opacity of social media algorithms has created a digital environment where users are left in the dark about how and why certain content reaches them. This lack of transparency raises questions about the impact on mental health and the potential manipulation of individual viewpoints.

## Our Solution

"Social Space" is a web platform designed to demystify social media algorithms, offering users unprecedented visibility into how their digital experiences are curated. With a focus on transparency, our project allows users to deconstruct algorithms, providing insights into content tailored to their preferences.

## Key Features

1. **Algorithm Deconstruction:** Unravel the intricacies of algorithms to understand how they curate personalized content.
2. **Comparative Analysis:** Compare your digital interests with the broader user base to gain insights into the uniqueness of your experience.
3. **Mental Health Empowerment:** Take control of your digital well-being by understanding how algorithms may impact your mental health.

## Technology Stack

- **Front End:** Developed using React for a seamless and user-friendly interface.
- **Web Scraping:** Python employed for effective web data extraction.
- **Backend:** Flask serves as the connective tissue linking the front end to the backend.
- **Clustering:** Utilizing NetworkX and GPT integration to cluster similar ideas and enhance user experience.

## Impact and Future Enhancements

"Social Space" aims to democratize algorithmic knowledge, empowering users to make informed decisions about their digital consumption. Our future plans include extending the platform to various social media algorithms and incorporating additional features to further enhance user control.
